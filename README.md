A sleek, modern, and user-friendly desktop application built with Python and custom Tkinter to check the status of any URL. It provides real-time feedback on whether a website is online, offline, or returning an error, all within a beautiful, non-blocking interface.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Modern UI:** A clean, dark-themed interface designed for a great user experience.
*   **Responsive & Non-Blocking:** The application uses threading to perform network checks, so the UI never freezes, even if a URL is slow to respond.
*   **Real-time Feedback:** Get instant status updates, including success codes (2xx) and error codes (4xx, 5xx).
*   **User-Friendly Input:** Includes placeholder text and automatically handles URLs with or without `http://` or `https://`.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** Gracefully manages connection timeouts, invalid URLs, and other network-related issues.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Built with Tkinter, Python's standard GUI package, making it compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

*   **Language:** Python
*   **GUI Framework:** Tkinter (`ttk` for modern styling)
*   **HTTP Library:** `requests`
*   **Concurrency:** `threading` and `queue` for a non-blocking UI.
